## Installation

After checking out the code, run the following commands

```
yarn
yarn start
```

If you run into errors, you may need to install `expo` globally:

```
npm install --global expo-cli
```

## Usage

The easiest way to use the app is to download the Expo Go app on your mobile device. This allows you to connect to the app while still in development.

After running `yarn start` the `expo-cli` will start up a server from which you can view the developer tools or connect with your mobile device. A QR code will print to the terminal, and you can scan the QR code and it will open the Expo Go app. You should now see the app on your mobile device.
